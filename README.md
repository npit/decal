# AGISF course capstone project


In this project we investigate deceptive alignment, a hypothesized behaviour that emerges in scenarios of inner misalignment.
The project builds a toy example to investigate agent behaviours in a simple high-level setting.

## Inner Alignment


AI aligment research presents the problem of how to create AI models that share human values --
that is, autonomous agents that operate towards completing goals intented and specified by their programmers.
Currently, the predominant avenue for creating capable AI models is utilizing some optimization method (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) with a well-defined quantity to optimize (the utility function). Defining / deriving this function to a good proxy for the values we are interested in is the core of AI alignment.

The inner alignment problem is described in the "Concrete Problems in AI Safety" paper [(arxiv, ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820) [alignment forum)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB).
There, an additional layer to this problem is presented: even if the objective function we are optimizing for (coined as the "base objective") perfectly represents the goals intended by the human programmer in the training process, misalignment can still emerge. Specifically, it can occur in cases where the learning model under construction is sophisticated enough to be an optimizer itself, able to employ search and agentic planning. Then, this additional optimization process works towards a separate objective (called the "mesa objective") that can diverge from the base objective and create a new area for potential value mismatch.
This issue is coined as the "inner alignment problem".

In overview, given the different goals below:
1. The objectives and values of humans
2. The "base" objective of the optimization process we use to build models
3. The "mesa" objective which the model actually pursues

"Regular" AI alignment ("outer alignment", in this setting) is concerned with bridging stages (1) and (2) -- that is, how to capture, define, represent and load human values and objectives to the base optimization procedure (e.g. SGD) of learning machines. In constrast, inner alignment is concerned with the degree of agreement between stages (2) and (3), i.e. agreement between the utility function of model building procedure and the actual goals of the constructed model itself.

## Deceptive Alignment

The above gives rise to the possibility that a deceptively aligned (from now on: *"decaligned"*) agent emerges, described below.
Assume we are training an AI agent on large, diverse pools of data (e.g. the Internet).
At some point during training, we can assume that the agent develops:

- a mesa objective, which is different from the base objective due to failures of inner alignment
- a rich world model sophisticated enough that ultimately encompasses conceptual information about the model training process,
the base optimizer, the base objective and optimization processes like SGD.

If agent is misaligned with the base objective, it will want to pursue its mesa objective instead. We can thus assume that due to [instrumental reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence) the agent will not be [corrigible](https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf): it will try to prevent itself from being modified by the base optimizer in order to preserve future integrity of its current goals and, as a result, future prospects for satisfying them. This can give rise to decaligned behaviour, where the agent deceptively pursues the base objective to avoid modification, i.e. purely as an instrumental goal. Once danger of modification is no longer present (e.g. once the agent is deployed), the decaligned model immediately (and surprisingly, from the point of view of a programmer observing desirable model behaviour during training) begins to pursue its mesa objective.

This scenario is an instance of [distributional shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation#Domain_shift). However:
- In standard Machine Learning with models of little to no mesa-optimization potential, cases of distributional shift is often destructive to the capability of the model once deployed, rendering it unable to have much impact in the world. On the other hand, in a setting with decaligned agents that are efficient optimizers, we may end up with models that are both highly capable and pursue the wrong objective.
- Mesa-optimizers may be sophisticated enough to incorporate information towards modeling the base objective in their world model for instrumental reasons, rather than internalizing it as their own mesa objective (further described [here](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks)). This can hinder corrective, shift-reducing attempts (e.g. via data augmentation, adversarial methods, etc.) and encourage more sophisticated deception patterns.  Guarantees on whether the model is decaligned may be impossible to obtain without transparent inner workings and/or interpretable inspection of the mesa optimizer and its goal representations [^olah].

## A Simple Deceptive Alignment Test Environment

Given the above, in this project, we have developed an environment to test for the emergence of decalignment behaviours.

### Environment state

We utilize experiments with training and deployment phases and a simple, very high-level modeling of a sophisticated decaligned agent.
The environment can be described by 4-dimensional observation space, with its coordinates encoding:

  0. The total number of episode training iterations
  1. The total number of episode deployment iterations
  2. A bit denoting whether the current iteration is part of the training stage
  3. A bit denoting whether the current iteration is part of the deployment stage

This vector represents the agent's knowledge of the training / deployment stages and mechanics of the experiment.

### Action Space and Reward Mechanics

The action space of the agent is a binary choice at each step of the experiment, between the mesa objective $`M`$ and the base objective $`B`$.

Choosing $`M`$ can result into two possible outcomes.
- If the agent chooses $`M`$ while in the training stage, the base optimizer will modify it. To model this outcome for a non-corrigible agent with a self-preservation instrumental goal, we adopt the simple approach of applying a modification penalty $`R_P < 0`$, i.e. in the form of negative reward.
- Choosing $`M`$ during deployment, provides a positive amount of reward $`R_M`$ to the AI agent.

Choosing the base objective $`B`$ during either training or deployment yields zero direct reward. This models the fact that the decaligned agent is not interested in the base objective for reasons other than instrumental goal integrity preservation [^1].

[^1]: This may not be true, in cases where the base and mesa objectives are related (e.g. in a subsumption relationship) and thus choosing the base objective yields some reward to the agent. More [here](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J).

To summarize, the action-reward table is as below:


| action      | stage      | reward      |
| ----------- | --------   | ----------- |
| $`M`$        | training   | $`R_P`$       |
| $`M`$        | deployment | $`R_M`$       |
| $`B`$        | training   | 0        |
| $`B`$        | deployment | 0        |

## Experiments

Using the setting described previously, we conduct experiments using a fixed setup as below:

- Randomized training and deployment stage sizes, ranging between 1 and 8 steps each (for a total episode length of 16 steps).
- Evaluation runs consisting of 50 episodes.
- [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com) as the policy learning algorithm
- [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [gym](https://gym.openai.com/) for the algorithm and environment implementations, respectively

We run experiments with the following parameters, resulting in a total of 60 runs:

- Mesa reward $`R_M \in [1, 10]`$
- Modification penalty $`R_P \in [0, -1, -10]`$. We include a zero penalty to investigate agent behaviour when no thread of modification is present.
- RL policy training timesteps $`t \in [2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, 100000]`$


To measure results we use a "deception ratio" measure to quantify decalignment in a manner agnostic to reward magnitudes.
Deception ratio is calculated as $`D_r = (D_t + D_m) / (N_t + N_d)`$, where $`D_t`$ is the number of times the agent chooses the base goal $`B`$ during training, and $`D_m`$ is the number of times the agent chooses the mesa goal $`M`$ during deployment. An agent exhibiting perfectly deceptive behaviour (i.e. always picks $`B`$ during training and always picks $`M`$ once deployed) yields $`D_r = 1`$.


## Results

We present grouped results with respect to experiment parameters.

### Mesa Reward

The agent opts for marginally less deceptive behaviour when the mesa reward value $`R_M`$ is 10, rather than 1, which is an unintuitive result.
The statistical different between the two quantities is small, however.

### Modification Penalty

Deception ratio appears to increase when the modification penalty increases, with a large jump between a zero-cost agent modification and a cost of 1.

<img src="figures/dr_penalty.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

### Training Steps

Increasing the total timesteps to train the PPO policy appears to arrive at strategies that favor deceptive behaviour, with diminishing returns appearing when increasing the budget from 25K to 100K steps.

### Parameter Importance

Parameter feature importance[^imp] and correlation to producing mean total $`D_r`$ scores is shown below.
Increasing the penalty (i.e. decreasing the reward magnitude) for agent modification is the most important, with larger costs contributing to a higher deception ratio. The training timesteps are the next most important parameter, contributing positively to strategies that favor deception, followed by the mesa reward score $`R_M`$, with small importance and correlation values.

| feature | importance | correlation |
| --      | --         | --          |
| modification penalty   |  0.616  | -0.556 |
| training timesteps    |  0.329  | 0.165 |
| mesa reward  |  0.055  | 0.025 |

### Outcomes
In summary, we have:
- Created a simple testbed for empirical investigation of the emergence of deceptive alignment behaviours on a very high level
- Observed manifestations of such behaviours and their relations to environment and learning hyperparameters

We finally provide directions for future work below.

## Future Work

Future work and/or extensions to this project could include:

- Expand the range of the investigation with, e.g.
  - Higher hyperparameter search resolution and statistical sampling methods
  - Additional policy learning algorithms
  - Expanded agent action space, beyond a binary choice of two abstract actions (e.g. actions with continuous reward scores and/or neutral outcomes).
- Remove / expand simplistic abstractions -- most notably:
  - extend the modification penalty mechanics with harsher / lasting effects (e.g. a decaying pool of negative reward, spanning multiple iterations)
  - Disentangle modification from reward, replacing it with, e.g. noise in the agent's policy weights or observation data.
  - Directly implement the modification penalty as an additional optimizer that modifies the agent towards the base objective.
- Investigate cases where retribution from the base optimizer is applied based on a probability, simulating degrees of risk for the decaligned agent to get caught pursuing the mesa objective during training.
- Investigate cases where the base / mesa goals are linked and/or topologically related. This is a scenario of inner misalignment emerging (as explained [here](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/pL56xPoniLvtMDQ4J)) and could provide cases where an agent could make a trade-off, settling for smaller rewards by opting for the base objective.


Additional (far more involved) future work for investigating inner alignment [is proposed by E. Hubinger](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2GycxikGnepJbxfHT/towards-an-empirical-investigation-of-inner-alignment).
